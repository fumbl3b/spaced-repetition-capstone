# Spaced Repetition Capstone

This is a full-stack application that can be used to learn new vocabulary using a spaced repetition memory technique.


* [Live Link](https://spaced-repetition-jade.vercel.app/)

## Setup

To setup the application

1. Fork and clone the project to your machine.  The repository contains both the client and server side codebases.
2. in each subdirectory run `npm install`. On the client side, you'll get the application *Cypress.io* for running browser integration tests

The project expects the the Spaced repetition API project setup and running on http://localhost:8000.

## API dev setup

If using user `dunder-mifflin`:

```bash
mv example.env .env
createdb -U dunder-mifflin spaced-repetition
createdb -U dunder-mifflin spaced-repetition-test
```

If your `dunder-mifflin` user has a password be sure to set it in `.env` for all appropriate fields. Or if using a different user, update appropriately.

```bash
npm install
npm run migrate
env MIGRATION_DB_NAME=spaced-repetition-test npm run migrate
```

And `npm test` should work at this point

## Configuring Postgres

For tests involving time to run properly, configure your Postgres database to run in the UTC timezone.

1. Locate the `postgresql.conf` file for your Postgres installation.
   1. E.g. for an OS X, Homebrew install: `/usr/local/var/postgres/postgresql.conf`
   2. E.g. on Windows, _maybe_: `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\11.2\data\postgresql.conf`
   3. E.g  on Ubuntu 18.04 probably: '/etc/postgresql/10/main/postgresql.conf'
2. Find the `timezone` line and set it to `UTC`:

```conf
# - Locale and Formatting -

datestyle = 'iso, mdy'
#intervalstyle = 'postgres'
timezone = 'UTC'
#timezone_abbreviations = 'Default'     # Select the set of available time zone
```

## Scripts

Start the application `npm start`

Start nodemon for the application `npm run dev`

Run the tests mode `npm test`

Run the migrations up `npm run migrate`

Run the migrations down `npm run migrate -- 0`

## Running project

This is a `create-react-app` project so `npm start` will start the project in development mode with hot reloading by default.

## Running the tests

This project uses [Cypress IO](https://docs.cypress.io) for integration testing using the Chrome browser.

Cypress has the following expectations:

- You have cypress installed (this is a devDependency of the project)
- You have your application running at http://localhost:3000.
  - You can change the address of this expectation in the `./cypress.json` file.
- Your `./src/config.js` is using http://localhost:8000/api as the `API_ENDPOINT`

To start the tests run the command:

```bash
npm run cypress:open
```

On the first run of this command, the cypress application will verify its install. Any other runs after this, the verification will be skipped.

The command will open up the Cypress application which reads tests from the `./cypress/integration/` directory. You can then run individual tests by clicking on the file names or run all tests by clicking the "run all tests" button in the cypress GUI.

Tests will assert against your running localhost client application.

You can also start all of the tests in the command line only (not using the GUI) by running the command:

```bash
npm run cypress:run
```

This will save video recordings of the test runs in the directory `./cypress/videos/`.
